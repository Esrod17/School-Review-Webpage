          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>The best definition I have for humidity is: <em>The amount of water vapor in air</em>. As crazy as it might seem, air can really carry water vapor!! Although it's capacity to carry water vapor changes with temperature, it's still pretty cool that it does it. Imagine a sponge, if you put a sponge that is already squeezed in the water and bring it out of the water, it cannot carry as much water as a fully extended sponge. Notice that in the picture below, Temperature is what expands or contracts the "sponge". Humidity is measured using an instrument called <strong>Hygrometer</strong>, and it's usually measured in <strong>relative humidity (RH)</strong> going from <strong>0% to 100%</strong> RH</p>

          <h3>Where does humidity come from?</h3>
          <p>As mentioned above, humidity comes from.... You guessed it: <strong><em>WATER</em></strong>. But there is one small thing to it, it has to be in <strong>GAS</strong> form!. The best example I can come up with is pockets, the hotter you are, the more pockets you have. But if you have more stuff than your pockets can handle, you have to keep them outside in your hands and everyone can see that. Just like the clouds in the sky, it's essentially extra humidity that can't be carried by the air so now everybody can see it.<strong></strong>. </p>

          <h3>How does it affect weather?</h3>
          <p>Humidity is how water is transported throughout our entire atmosphere. Along with temperature it's the reason clouds are formed and provide us rain and in the same way (if it's cold enough) snow. I guess that just with that we can assume that humidity is a pretty important property of our weather!</p>

          <h3>Takeaways for this section:</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Humidity is how much water VAPOR is in the air</li>
              <li>Hotter air can carry more water vapor without forming clouds</li>
              <li>As moist air cools, the relative humidity INCREASES</li>
              <li>It provides us rain and snow!</li>
