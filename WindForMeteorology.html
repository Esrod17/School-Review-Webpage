          <h3>What is really wind?</h3>
          <p>It might seem ridiculous to define such a common word but as mentioned before, any respectable scientist will always learn the definition of what they are studying in order to better understand it. The best definition I have for wind is: <em>The flow of gases from one place to another</em>. This might be the shortest definition section I have but nonetheless it's important to establish it so we can study effectively. It is measured using an instrument called <strong>Anemometer</strong>, and it's measured in <strong>Knots (kts)</strong> or <strong>Miles per Hour (mph)</strong></p>

          <h3>Where does it even come from?</h3>
          <p>In order to move anything regardless of how much it weights, one needs energy. And in order to move something as large as <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> the air above you, one needs vast amounts of energy. This energy in our atmosphere comes from the <strong>difference in air pressure</strong>. A good example is an inflated balloon, when you inflate it to it's capacity the pressure inside of it is greater than the outside air, that's why it feels so hard. When you open the balloon, it lets out a rush of air towards the outsie because the air always moves from high pressure to low pressure as shown below.</p>

          <h3>How does it affect weather?</h3>
          <p>Wind transports everything in the atmosphere, Its like a car that takes you places. If your car doesn't work, you can't move anywhere. Without wind, the clouds don't move, ocean currents would be less strong, leaves will not shake in any tree. Simply put, without wind, Earth would have an atmosphere without weather.</p>

          <h3>Takeaways for this section:</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Wind is the movement of air</li>
              <li>It is caused by difference in pressure</li>
              <li>It happens side-to-side and "up or down"</li>
              <li>Without it, there's no weather!</li>
