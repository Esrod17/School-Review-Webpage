          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>The definition for precipitation is: <em>Any form of water (Rain or Snow) FALLING from the sky</em>. The key word here is falling, water in the sky is not precipitation until it starts dropping to towards the ground. it is measured by using a <strong>Rain Gauge</strong>, and it's usually measured in <strong>Inches (in)</strong> althouygh any other unit of length can be used.</p>

          <h3>How does precipitation from?</h3>
          <p>Precipitation is part of the<strong><em>WATER CYCLE</em></strong>. But it can only occur after <em>CONDENSATION</em> (Which is when water turns from a gas to a liquid). When enough liquid water (or snow) forms in the clouds to the point that it's too heavy for it to keep floating, <strong>Precipitation</strong> occurs! </p>

          <h3>How does it affect weather?</h3>
          <p>Precipitation is the way out atmosphere moves moisture from the heights of the skies, to the ground below. Without it, out planet would just be an enormous desert. Lakes and rivers would ot have been formed, and Oceans would have not been formed. </p>

          <h3>Takeaways for this section:</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Precipitation is water falling from the sky</li>
              <li>It can be in liquid or solid form</li>
              <li>It moves the water from "Up in the sky to Down in the ground"</li>
              <li>Without it, the planet would be a desert</li>
