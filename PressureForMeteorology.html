      <h3>What is Atmospheric Pressure?</h3>
      <p>Pressure is defined by <em>weight over a specific area</em>. The word atmospheric just means <em>(of the atmosphere)</em>, so when putting them together It means weight of the atmosphere above you. It may seem weird to grasp since air is so light but yes, the atmosphere that surrounds Earth has weight and pushes down on anything below it. The device used to measure it is called a <strong>Barometer</strong> and there are multiple units in which it is expressed, the two most common are called millibar (mbar, mb) and "inches of mercury" (inHg).</p>

      <h3>How does atmospheric pressure even change?</h3>  
      <p>There are a couple of ways to experience pressure change, the biggest one is from changing height or <em>altitude</em>. Just like in the picture above, the lower you are in the atmosphere, the more molecules of air you have above exerting their weight on you thus, you will be experiencing more pressure. The other way is to change the temperature if the air, if the air above you is warmer, it will become less dense or <em>lighter</em>. And you will experience a lower pressure, it is also true for the opposite. The colder the air, the denser and heavier it becomes an you will experience a higher atmospheric pressure.</p>

      <h3>How does it affect Weather?</h3>  
      <p>The pressure of the atmosphere mainly dictates what movement will the air have. The most basic thing to understand is that <strong>high pressure air moves towards low pressure air</strong> while <strong>low pressure air "runs away" from high pressure air</strong>. This will have several consequences, high pressure often means dry weather with sunshine. Low pressure often means clouds and precipitation or "rain".</p>
